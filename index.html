      <h2>Information</h2>
      <p>
        During the year 2023 my sister and I wanted to read a book a week so she
        picked half the books and I picked the other half. I added all of them
        into a randomizer and thats how it was determined which book to read
        from the beggining to the end. We planned out the books so that we knew
        what was coming and could request or reserve books ahead of time or
        check them out in chunks.
